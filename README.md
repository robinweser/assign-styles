# assign-styles
```sh
npm install assign-styles
```
ES6 Polyfill for `Object.assign` that respects **!important** notation.<br>
This does the same as [object-assign](https://github.com/sindresorhus/object-assign), but was made especially for style objects as they're used e.g. in React to define inline-styles.
